# Siddhi 5.x Config Guide

## Database Configuration

This section is applicable only for Local, Docker, and Kubernetes Modes and not for Java and Python Modes.

RDBMS databases are recommended to be configured as datasources in Siddhi configuration, as this allow database connection reuse. By default Siddhi stores product-specific data in its predefined embedded H2 database located in `<SIDDHI_RUNNER_HOME>/wso2/runner/database` directory. Though, this is suitable for development, testing, and some production environments that do not store data. However, for most production environments <b>we recommend using industry-standard RDBMS such as Oracle, PostgreSQL, MySQL, or MS SQL</b>. At this movement, the users also need to add the database drivers to Siddhi's class-path.

The necessary table schemas are self generated by the feature itself, other than for the database based metrics monitoring. The scripts to create these tables are provided in the <code>&lt;SIDDHI_RUNNER_HOME&gt;/wso2/runner/dbscripts</code> directory.

<p>These datasources configurations will be passed to Siddhi during startup.</p>

!!! Note "Including database drivers."
    The database driver corresponding to the database used should be added to <code>&lt;SIDDHI_RUNNER_HOME&gt;/lib/</code> directory, to communicate with the database.

!!! Tip "Converting Non OSGI drivers."
    If the database driver is not an OSGI bundle, then it should be converted to OSGI. Please refer [Adding Third Party Non OSGi Libraries](http://siddhi.io/documentation/siddhi-5.x/config-guide-5.x/#adding-third-party-non-osgi-libraries) documentation for details.

<p>Below are the sample datasource configuration for each supported database types:</p>

<ul>
<li> MySQL </li>
  <script src="https://gist.github.com/pcnfernando/5911341d74f36a3f99252cc859a7f836.js"></script>

<li> Oracle </li>
<p>There are two ways to configure Oracle. If you have a System Identifier (SID), use this (older) format:</p>
```
jdbc:oracle:thin:@[HOST][:PORT]:SID
```
<script src="https://gist.github.com/pcnfernando/c32d6b0d12c49dfe2ea91100db9c728c.js"></script>

<p>If you have an Oracle service name, use this (newer) format:</p>
```
jdbc:oracle:thin:@//[HOST][:PORT]/SERVICE
```
<script src="https://gist.github.com/pcnfernando/35e7f82f9aceed3cb28531ac8e36699c.js"></script>

<li>PostgreSQL</li>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/pcnfernando/a48ce3c0422cd5db5657758e85f4bc9f.js"></script>

<li>MS SQL</li>
</ul>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/pcnfernando/b095e794ad753e11ca58b2a5bafe080e.js"></script>

## Configuring Periodic State Persistence

This section explains how to prevent the loss of data that can result from a system failure by persisting the state of
Siddhi periodically either into a database system or into the file system.

### Prerequisites
Before configuring database persistence, the following prerequisites must be completed.

* One or more Siddhi Applications must be running in Siddhi Runner.
* A working RDBMS instance that can be used for data persistence must exist.
* The requirements of the datasource must be already defined.
* Database persistence involves updating the databases connected to Siddhi Runner with the latest information relating to the events that are being processed by Siddhi at a given time.

### Configuring Database System Persistence
<p>The supported databases are H2, MySQL, PostgreSQL, MSSQL and Oracle. The relevant jdbc driver jar should be downloaded and added to the <code>&lt;SIDDHI_RUNNER_HOME&gt;/lib</code> directory to prior to using database system persistence.</p>
<p>To configure periodic data persistence, update the <code>&lt;SIDDHI_RUNNER_HOME&gt;/conf/worker/deployment.yaml</code> file under <code>state.persistence</code> <span style="font-family: monospace;"> </span>as follows:</p>

| Parameter | Purpose | Required Value |
| ------------- |-------------|-------------|
| enabled | This enables data persistence. | true |
| intervalInMin | The time interval in minutes that defines the interval in which state of Siddhi applications should be persisted | 1 |
| revisionsToKeep | The number of revisions to keep in the system. When a new persist takes place, the old revisions are removed. | 3 |
| persistenceStore | The persistence store | io.siddhi.distribution.core.persistence.DBPersistenceStore |
| config > datasource | The datasource to be used in persisting the state. The provided datasource should be properly defined in the deployment.yaml. For detailed instructions of how to configure a datasource, see [Configuring Datasources](###Configuring Datasources).| SIDDHI_PERSISTENCE_DB (Datasource with this name should be defined in wso2.datasources) |
| config > table | The table that should be created and used for the persisting of the state. | PERSISTENCE_TABLE |

<p> The following is a sample segment of the required configurations in the <code>&lt;SIDDHI_RUNNER_HOME&gt;/conf/runner/deployment.yaml</code> file to configure file system persistence.</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/pcnfernando/7b94df53248fb626867bd7b64019a109.js"></script>

### Configuring File System Persistence
<p>This section explains how to persist the states of Siddhi applications during a required time interval in the file system in order to maintain back-ups. To configure state persistence, update the <code>&lt;SIDDHI_RUNNER_HOME&gt;/conf/runner/deployment.yaml</code> file under <code>state.persistence</code> <span> </span>as follows:</p>

| Parameter | Purpose | Required Value |
| ------------- |-------------|-------------|
| enabled | This enables data persistence. | true |
| intervalInMin | The time interval in minutes that defines the interval in which state of Siddhi applications should be persisted | 1 |
| revisionsToKeep | The number of revisions to keep in the system. When a new persist takes place, the old revisions are removed. | 3 |
| persistenceStore | The persistence store | io.siddhi.distribution.core.persistence.FileSystemPersistenceStore |
| config > location | A fully qualified folder location to where the revision files should be persisted. | siddhi-app-persistence |

<p>The following is a sample segment of the required configurations in the <code>&lt;SIDDHI_RUNNER_HOME&gt;/conf/runner/deployment.yaml</code> file to configure file system persistence.</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/pcnfernando/19f1879b86bd96a25762e2cadf8ae407.js"></script>

## Defining and Configuring Siddhi Extensions Externally

<p>Siddhi extensions cater usecase specific logics that are not out of the box available in Siddhi Streaming engine.
You can define and configure these extensions in-line within the Siddhi application or externally in Siddhi Runner configuration file. </p>

### Defining Sources, Sinks and Tables Externally

<p> A source, sink or a table could be defined externally, and referred from several siddhi applications as described below.</p>
<p>Multiple sources can be defined in the <code>&lt;SIDDHI_RUNNER_HOME&gt;/conf/runner/deployment.yaml</code> file. </p>

<p>The following is a sample configuration of a source.</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/pcnfernando/323f593b9ae1e814cedc880892cdf26f.js"></script>

<p>You can refer to a source configured in the <code>&lt;SIDDHI_RUNNER_HOME&gt;/conf/runner/deployment.yaml</code> file from a Siddhi application as shown in the example below.</p>
```
@Source(ref='source1', basic.auth.enabled='false',
        @map(type='json', @attributes( name='$.name', amount='$.quantity')))
define stream SweetProductionStream (name string, amount double);
```
For detailed instructions to configure a source, see [Siddhi Guide - Source](http://siddhi-io.github.io/siddhi/documentation/siddhi-5.x/query-guide-5.x/#source)

### Configuring Siddhi Extensions Externally

<p>The pre-written Siddhi extensions supported by Siddhi Runner are configured with default values for system parameters.
If you need to override those values, you can refer to those extensions from the <code>&lt;SIDDHI_RUNNER_HOME&gt;/conf/runner/deployment.yaml</code> file and
add the system parameters with the required values as key-value pairs. </p>

<p>The following is a sample configuration of an extension.</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/pcnfernando/52f8720842bd5feca1481e1b5266b853.js"></script>

<p>For each separate extension you want to configure, add a sub-section named extension under the extensions subsection.</p>

<p>Following are examples for overriding default values for system properties.</p>

<p>Example 1: Defining host and port for TCP</p>
```
siddhi:
  extensions:
    - extension:
        name: tcp
        namespace: source
        properties:
          host: 0.0.0.0
          port: 5511
```
<p>Example 2: Overwriting the default RDBMS configuration</p>
```
siddhi:
  extensions:
    - extension:
        name: rdbms
        namespace: store
        properties:
          mysql.batchEnable: true
          mysql.batchSize: 1000
          mysql.indexCreateQuery: "CREATE INDEX {{TABLE_NAME}}_INDEX ON {{TABLE_NAME}} ({{INDEX_COLUMNS}})"
          mysql.recordDeleteQuery: "DELETE FROM {{TABLE_NAME}} {{CONDITION}}"
          mysql.recordExistsQuery: "SELECT 1 FROM {{TABLE_NAME}} {{CONDITION}} LIMIT 1"
```          

## Adding Extensions and Third Party Libraries

<p> The Siddhi extensions supported for Siddhi Runner are shipped with Siddhi Runner by default.
If you need to download and install a different version of an extension or add an external dependency,
follow the sections below broken down based on various environments. </p>

### Adding to Siddhi Java library

<p>You can add Siddhi extension jars and third-party libraries as dependencies when using Siddhi as a Java library.</p>
<p>Following is a sample <code>pom.xml</code> dependency snippet which includes Siddhi mandatory dependencies and <code>siddhi-io-http</code> extension.</p>

```xml
<!--Siddhi Mandatory Dependencies-->
 <dependency>
     <groupId>io.siddhi</groupId>
     <artifactId>siddhi-core</artifactId>
     <version>5.x.x</version>
   </dependency>
   <dependency>
     <groupId>io.siddhi</groupId>
     <artifactId>siddhi-query-api</artifactId>
     <version>5.x.x</version>
   </dependency>
   <dependency>
     <groupId>io.siddhi</groupId>
     <artifactId>siddhi-query-compiler</artifactId>
     <version>5.x.x</version>
   </dependency>
   <dependency>
     <groupId>io.siddhi</groupId>
     <artifactId>siddhi-annotations</artifactId>
     <version>5.x.x</version>
   </dependency>
   <dependency>
     <groupId>io.siddhi</groupId>
     <artifactId>siddhi-annotations</artifactId>
     <version>5.x.x</version>
   </dependency>

<!--Extension Dependencies-->
   <dependency>
     <groupId>org.wso2.extension.siddhi.io.http</groupId>
     <artifactId>siddhi-io-http</artifactId>
     <version>${siddhi.io.http.version}</version>
   </dependency>   
```

You can find a quick start guide in [Using Siddhi as a library](https://siddhi-io.github.io/siddhi/documentation/siddhi-5.x/user-guide-5.x/#using-siddhi-as-a-java-library) documentation.

### Adding to Siddhi Local Micro Service
<p>You can install the Siddhi extensions and third-party dependencies in your Siddhi Runner local pack by placing the JARs you downloaded in the <code>&lt;SIDDHI_RUNNER_HOME&gt;/lib</code> directory.

<p>Since Siddhi Runner is a OSGi-based product, when you integrate third party products such as Oracle with Siddhi Runner, you need to check whether the libraries you need to add to Siddhi Runner are OSGi based. If they are not, you need to convert them to OSGi bundles before adding them to the <code>&lt;SIDDHI_RUNNER_HOME&gt;/lib</code> directory.</p>
Please refer [Converting Third Party Non OSGi Libraries](http://siddhi.io/documentation/siddhi-5.x/config-guide-5.x/#converting-third-party-non-osgi-libraries) documentation.

### Adding to Siddhi Docker Micro Service

<p>You have to manually build a docker image using the below docker file bundling the needed extensions and third-party libraries.</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/pcnfernando/09d3af8f958c464425a892efabac2d98.js"></script>

Here, we use the siddhi-runner-base-alpine as the base image while creating the image. The parent/base image bundles the Alpine Linux OS, JDK and the Siddhi distribution.
You can find the Siddhi Runner docker build artifacts in [docker-siddhi repository](https://github.com/siddhi-io/docker-siddhi/tree/master/docker-files/siddhi-runner).

Copy the needed OSGIfied JARs and extensions to the ${BUNDLE_JAR_DIR} as defined in the above docker file, so that it would be bundled during the building phase to the docker image.
Please refer [Converting Third Party Non OSGi Libraries](http://siddhi.io/documentation/siddhi-5.x/config-guide-5.x/#converting-third-party-non-osgi-libraries) documentation to convert non OSGI bundles before bundling it to the image.

You can find a quick start guide in [Using Siddhi as a Docker microservice](https://siddhi-io.github.io/siddhi/documentation/siddhi-5.x/user-guide-5.x/#using-siddhi-as-a-docker-micro-service) documentation.

### Adding to Siddhi Kubernetes Micro Service

To use a Siddhi Runner distribution bundled with extensions and third party libraries, you have to first create a docker image following the steps described in [Adding to Docker Micro Service](https://siddhi-io.github.io/siddhi/documentation/siddhi-5.x/config-guide-5.x/#adding-to-docker-micro-service) documentation.
This created image can be referenced from the Siddhi Kubernetes artifacts thereafter.

You can find a quick start guide in [Using Siddhi as Kubernetes microservice](https://siddhi-io.github.io/siddhi/documentation/siddhi-5.x/user-guide-5.x/#using-siddhi-as-kubernetes-micro-service) documentation.

### Converting Third Party Non OSGi Libraries

<p>To convert jar files to OSGi bundles, follow the procedure given below:</p>
<ol>
<li>
Download the non-OSGi jar for the required third party product, and save it in a preferred directory in your machine.
</li>
<li>
In your CLI, navigate to the <code>&lt;SIDDHI_RUNNER_HOME&gt;/bin</code> directory. Then issue the following command.

```
./jartobundle.sh <PATH_TO_NON-OSGi_JAR> ../lib
```

This generates the converted file in the <code>&lt;SIDDHI_RUNNER_HOME&gt;/lib</code> directory.
</li>
<li>
Restart the Siddhi Runner.
</li>
</ol>

## Configuring metrics

Siddhi Runner uses WSO2 Carbon Metrics which provides an API for using the [Metrics library](https://metrics.dropwizard.io/4.0.0/). Siddhi Runner is shipped with JVM Metrics to monitor statistics of your Siddhi Runner using Java Metrics. 

To enable metrics and to configure metric-related properties, do the following configurations in the <code>&lt;SIDDHI_RUNNER_HOME&gt;/conf/runner/deployment.yaml</code> file.
<ol>
<li>
To enable wso2 metrics, set the enabled property to true under wso2.metrics as shown below.

```
wso2.metrics:
  enabled: true
```
</li>
<li>
To enable JDBC reporting and configure properties to clean up the database entries, add the below configuration in <code>&lt;SIDDHI_RUNNER_HOME&gt;/conf/runner/deployment.yaml</code> file.  
If JDBC reporting is not enabled in <code>wso2.metrics.jdbc: => reporting:</code>, information relating to metrics history will not be persisted for future references. You need to wait for the time duration specified as the pollingPeriod for the initial reporting to be persisted in the datasource configured.
For detailed instructions of how to configure a datasource, see [Configuring Datasources](http://siddhi.io/documentation/siddhi-5.x/config-guide-5.x/#configuring-datasources)

```
wso2.metrics.jdbc:
  # Data Source Configurations for JDBC Reporters
  dataSource:
    # Default Data Source Configuration
    - &JDBC01
      # JNDI name of the data source to be used by the JDBC Reporter.
      # This data source should be defined under wso2.datasources.
      dataSourceName: java:comp/env/jdbc/SiddhiMetricsDB
      # Schedule regular deletion of metrics data older than a set number of days.
      # It is recommended that you enable this job to ensure your metrics tables do not get extremely large.
      # Deleting data older than seven days should be sufficient.
      scheduledCleanup:
        # Enable scheduled cleanup to delete Metrics data in the database.
        enabled: false
 
        # The scheduled job will cleanup all data older than the specified days
        daysToKeep: 7
 
        # This is the period for each cleanup operation in seconds.
        scheduledCleanupPeriod: 86400
        
  reporting:
      # The JDBC Reporter configurations will be ignored if the Metrics JDBC Core feature is not available in runtime
      jdbc:
        - # The name for the JDBC Reporter
          name: JDBC
  
          # Enable JDBC Reporter
          enabled: true
  
          # Source of Metrics, which will be used to identify each metric in database -->
          # Commented to use the hostname by default
          # source: Carbon
  
          # Alias referring to the Data Source configuration
          dataSource: *JDBC01
  
          # Polling Period in seconds.
          # This is the period for polling metrics from the metric registry and updating the database with the values
          pollingPeriod: 60      
```
| Parameter | Default Value | Description |
| ------------- |-------------|-------------|
|dataSource	| &JDBC01	|            |
|dataSource > dataSourceName |	java:comp/env/jdbc/SiddhiMetricsDB |	The name of the datasource used to store metric data.|
|dataSource > scheduledCleanup > enabled |	false |	If this is set to true, metrics data stored in the database is cleared at a specific time interval as scheduled. |
|dataSource > scheduledCleanup > daysToKeep |	3 |	If scheduled clean-up of metric data is enabled, all metric data in the database that are older than the number of days specified in this parameter are deleted.|
|dataSource > scheduledCleanup > scheduledCleanupPeriod |	86400 |	This parameter specifies the time interval in seconds at which all metric data stored in the database must be cleared.|
</li>

<li>
JVM metrics of which the log level is set to OFF are not measured by default. If you need to monitor one or more of them, add the relevant metric name(s) under the <code>wso2.metrics: => levels</code> subsection as shown in the extract below. As shown below, you also need to mention log4j mode in which the metrics need to be monitored (i.e., OFF, INFO, DEBUG, TRACE, or ALL). 

```
wso2.metrics:
 # Enable Metrics
   enabled: true
    jmx:
      # Register MBean when initializing Metrics
    registerMBean: true
      # MBean Name
    name: org.wso2.carbon:type=Metrics
    # Metrics Levels are organized from most specific to least:
    # OFF (most specific, no metrics)
    # INFO
    # DEBUG
    # TRACE (least specific, a lot of data)
    # ALL (least specific, all data)
 levels:
      # The root level configured for Metrics
    rootLevel: INFO
      # Metric Levels
    levels:
         jvm.buffers: 'OFF'
         jvm.class-loading: INFO
         jvm.gc: DEBUG
         jvm.memory: INFO
```
</li>

Please refer [Siddhi Applicaiton Statistics documentation](https://siddhi-io.github.io/siddhi/documentation/siddhi-5.x/query-guide-5.x/#statistics) for enabling Siddhi application level metrics for a Siddhi application.
